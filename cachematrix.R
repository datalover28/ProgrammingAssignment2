##Sometimes certain operations in R like calculating the inverse takes much time if the matrix is big enough
##but if we have to calculate inverse of the matrices in loop and if the content in the matrices are same 
##then it makes sense to cache the value of inverse instead of performing the operation again and again for same content in matrices
##so these functions will cache the value of inverse of matrix

# first function, makeCacheMatrix creates a special "matrix", which is really a list containing a function to
#set the value of the matrix
#get the value of the matrix
#set the value of the inverse
#get the value of the inverse
#The second function calculates the inverse of the special "matrix" created with the above function. 
#However, it first checks to see if the inverse has already been calculated. 
#If so, it gets the inverse from the cache and skips the computation. 
#Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of the matrix and sets the value of the inverse in the cache via the setinverse function.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  i <- NULL
  set <- function(y){
    x <<- y
    i <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(inverse) i <<- inverse
  getinverse <- function() i
  list(set = set,
       get = get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)
}


##  This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
##If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  i <- x$getinverse()
  if(!is.null(i)){
    message("getting cached data")
    return(i)
  }
  mat <- x$get()
  i <- solve(mat, ...)
  x$setinverse(i)
  i
}
